Keyflow has also organised private-events (e.g. Absolut Nights, Marshall Headphones) to connect with nightclub owners in Sweden - another platform to test new features and collect user-feedback.

Further field-tests took place in person during office-hours and nightlife events. Major features such as RSVP or QR-code tickets required field-testing in event conditions, where a doorman, an event manager and number of guests were required. Keyflow team had the chance to collaborate with brands like Absolut, Marshall, Peroni and Universal Studios in order to host nightlife professionals where feature-tests were held to gain meaningful insights and user-feedbacks from professionals. Handling of invitations, listing of events and intrusiveness of advertisements were prototyped in Principle App for micro-interactions.

            Text1="Keyflow is currently the main nightlife platform of Scandinavia with a growing number of users who discover nightlife events and venues through the platform. As an integrated nightlife solution, the product has branched out to provide unique solutions to the needs of various types of guests. Team's understanding of the ecosystem has increased as the product and user-base has grown. Request feature has been the most significant disruption in the industry and its development did not follow a straight-line. Introduction of Keyflow Coins was based on surveys and user-interviews to help venues engage more with guest list requests. Coins were expected to add value to the requests, save time for venues and help to gather user information and reward mechanism. Even though introduction of Coins has increased request-engagement on both sides (guests &amp; venues), it proved to have room for improvement to reach a wider-audience. Keyflow has come up with a newer and more transparent approach to increase request engagement by making changes on Keyflow Business (venue response rate). Nightlife dynamics show a large variety globally, and Keyflow has the following challenges:"
